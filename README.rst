Monasca Specifications
======================


This git repository is used to hold priorities and approved design
specifications for additions to the Monasca project. Reviews of the specs are
done in gerrit, using a similar workflow to how we review and merge changes to
the code itself.

The layout of this repository is::

  priorities/<release>/
  specs/<release>/

Where there are two sub-directories in ``specs``:

specs/<release>/approved
  specifications approved, but not yet implemented

specs/<release>/implemented
  implemented specifications
